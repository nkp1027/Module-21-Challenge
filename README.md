# Module-21-Challenge

## Description
I will be creating a ERC-20 compliant token (KaseiCoin). I will be creating the KaseiCoin contract and crowdsale contract as well as deploying both. I will run a test as well using Remix IDE, MetaMask and Ganache.

## Evaluation Evidence

The following shows a compiled contract of KaseiCoin.

This shows the compiled KaseiCoinCrowdsale before the deployer.

This shows the compilation of the KaseiCoinCrowdsale contract.

There are videos that accompany all of these screenshots if you desire to see it live in action in the EvaluationEvidence folder in this repository. The videos will show successfull deployment of the KaseiCoinCrowdsale and KaseiCoin contracts as well as testing the accounts in buying tokens and checking balances afterwards. You will also see a supply of minted tokens and how much wei was made in the process.

Below is a screenshot of Ganache transactions.

This is the MetaMask wallet which shows evidence of transaction and the receipt of the coins that were bought.
